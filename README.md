# 🐧 Penguins Species Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a **simple machine learning model** to predict the species of penguins based on physical measurements.  
It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to make predictions and demonstrates a complete beginner-friendly ML workflow.

## Dataset
- Source: [Palmer Archipelago Penguins Dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/penguins)  
- Contains measurements of penguins’ physical attributes.
- **Features used:**
  - Culmen Length (mm)
  - Culmen Depth (mm)
  - Flipper Length (mm)
  - Body Mass (g)
- **Target:**
  - Species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)

## Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values and cleaned column names.  
   - Selected features and target for the model.

2. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Used **Random Forest Classifier** to train the model.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Predicted on the test set and calculated **accuracy score**.

## Results
- Example Accuracy: `95%` (your accuracy may vary depending on random split)
